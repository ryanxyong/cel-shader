            <p>
                We refer to <a href="https://youtu.be/mnxs6CR6Zrk">this video</a> by Jasper to gain
                a grasp of how cel shading was done in Zelda: The Wind Waker, which pioneered the 
                shading method. We adapted the "toonification" part of the shading to a scale from 
                0 to 1 instead of 0 to 255, as suggested in the video, because it follows three.js convention. 
                We opted to use the small range from 0.47 to 0.53 luminosity, which we found by using the 120/255
                and 136/255 values that Jasper mentions in the video to stay true to the aesthetic of cel
                shading as seen in Zelda: The Wind Waker. Compared to the previous task, one will see
                the difference in the amount of shape that is illuminated by the light with a rather
                rapid (but still gradual) change in light and dark portions of each shape. All luminosities
                that were less than or equal to 0.47 were black and those that were greater than or equal
                to 0.53 were white.
